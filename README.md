 ## Implementation for [Sparse intrinsic decomposition and applications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.image.2021.116281)


## Environment
The codes are test on **Ubuntu 16.04, Matlab 2016b**.


## Test on the provided examples from MPI-Sintel dataset:
1) Run the following cammand within Matlab to get the results. The results are saved in ```./Output_results``` by default.
```
demo
```
2) Run the following command within Matlab to calcuate the numerical results (MSE, LMSE).
```
evaluate_output
```


## Bibtex
We are happy to be cited when our codes are useful in your projects.
